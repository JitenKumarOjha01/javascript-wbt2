- Javascript is used for building logics of a web page. 
- javascript is a high level programming language, used in both client side as well as server side. 
- javascript comes from echma script so we see the latest version of javascript in the form of echma script. 
- Now we used javascript version 6 i.e ES6 (echma script 6)
- In another way we called ES6 as the vanilla Javascript.
- Node JS is the run time environment of javascript. 

Operators in js:-
-operators are the kye features to do some task or operate some task.
-ex- A+B
- in the above example A & B are the operands ,"+" is our operator.
- injavascript, there are 5 types of operator are there:-
  1. Arithmatic operator-> (+,-,*,/), %(modulus), **(exponent)
  2. assignment Operator-> 





  Logical AND (&&)
    A    B    AND(&&)
    T    T      T
    T    F      F
    F    T      F
    F    F      F

  LOGICAL OR(||)

    A    B    OR(||)
    T    T      T
    T    F      F
    F    T      F
    F    F      F



Variable :- 

- variable is a container to store some data.
- in javascript there are 3 types of variable are there...

1. var :-

- var is a type of variable which is used for changing the variable in later stage. 
- var is used in oldest browser so now a days we are don't use var most of the cases. 

2. let :- 

- let is a type of variable which is also used for changing the variable in later stage.
- Now these days, most of the cases we used let for changing the variable.
- let is a block scope code so we have been used let in most cases. 

3. const :- const means constant. 

Rules for creating variable name :- 

- variables names are case sensative "a" & "A" is different.
- Only letter, digits, underscore & special character is allowed. (do not keep white space over here).
- only letter, underscore or special character should be the 1st character only. 
- reserved words cannot be a variable name. 
ex. for, while, var , let, this, boolean etc... 

Datatype in Javascript :- 

- datatypes is an attributes associated with a peice of data that tells a computer system how to interprit its value. 
- in datatype we used "typeof" operator to know what type of data it is. 
- mainlly in javascript there are 2 type of datatypes are there. 

1. primitive Datatype :- 

- in javascript there are 7 types of primitive datatypes are there like..

1. Number - Numbera re the type of datatypes those it contains some numerical values
2. Boolean - in boolean datatype we got boolean value like true/false
3. Undefiend - data is not define
4. Null - in this datatype we got null for the value means nothing
5. bigInt - in bigint we will get the big integer value (-999999999 to +999999999) on the above.
6. String - string is a type of datatype that can hold some character like names or words etc.. 
7. Symbol - in symbol we got one symbol of more than one value.

2. Reference Datatype

- reference datatypes are the type of datatype which can hold multiple element in a single frame.
- reference datatypes are -> array, object, function

1. Array :- 

- Array is a coolection of similar type of datatype which can hold contigious memory location. 
- array indexing start from "0".

ex. let arr = ["hari", "sita", "ram"]
                 0        1       2

2. Object :- 

- object is a reference type of datatype where we can store more then one element is a single frame. 
- mainly object are working on (key:value) pair.

ex:- 

let hari = {
    "name" : "hari bandu sahoo",
    "phone no" : 56789032,
    "address" : "bhubaneswar",
    "carrier" : "good"
}

- in the above example left side element are the keys & right side elements are the values of that key.

const accountId = 1234 

// const - variable, accountId - varaible name, 1234 - variable value.
let accountEmail = "web.bocket@gmail.com"
var accountPassword = "12345"
accountCity = "bhubaneswar"
let accountState; // it will execute but give the ans -> undefined

console.log(accountId)
console.log(accountEmail)
console.log(accountPassword)
console.log(accountCity)
console.log(accountState)

// let age = 34;
// console.log(age) // 34
// console.log(typeof(age)) // number

// var a = "web bocket"
// console.log(a) // web bocket
